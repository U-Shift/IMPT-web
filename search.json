    "text": "Transport poverty refers to an individual or household inability to access essential services, opportunities, and social participation due to limited, inadequate, unaffordable, unreliable or non-existent means of transport (Mejía Dorantes and Murauskaite-Bull, 2022). However, due to the lack of a universal definition and its multidimensional nature the identification and measurement of transport poverty can be challenging.\nThis project aims to tackle this challenge by developing a multidimensional index that enables its measurement and monitoring over time at both national and regional levels, with the aim of identifying priority areas for intervention and supporting a just mobility transition."
